The **DevOps lifecycle** is a continuous process that integrates development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to streamline software delivery, enhance collaboration, and automate processes. Below are the key stages of the DevOps lifecycle, along with their explanations:

---

### **1. Plan** 📝  
- **Objective:** Define project goals, requirements, and strategies.  
- **Key Activities:**  
  - Gather and analyze requirements.  
  - Define the roadmap and features.  
  - Use tools like **JIRA, Confluence, or Trello** for planning.  

---

### **2. Develop (Build & Code)** 💻  
- **Objective:** Write, review, and manage the source code.  
- **Key Activities:**  
  - Developers write and update code.  
  - Use version control systems like **Git, GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket**.  
  - Code is stored in a central repository.  

---

### **3. Build** 🔨  
- **Objective:** Compile the code into executable artifacts.  
- **Key Activities:**  
  - Convert source code into binaries/packages.  
  - Use build tools like **Maven, Gradle, or Ant**.  
  - Perform dependency management.  

---

### **4. Test** 🧪  
- **Objective:** Verify code quality and detect defects.  
- **Key Activities:**  
  - Perform **unit, integration, and functional testing**.  
  - Use automation tools like **Selenium, JUnit, TestNG**.  
  - Continuous testing ensures early bug detection.  

---

### **5. Release** 🚀  
- **Objective:** Package and prepare the software for deployment.  
- **Key Activities:**  
  - Manage versioning using **Artifact Repositories** (e.g., **JFrog Artifactory, Nexus, AWS CodeArtifact**).  
  - Ensure approvals and compliance checks.  
  - Deploy the package to staging environments.  

---

### **6. Deploy** 📦  
- **Objective:** Deploy the software into the production environment.  
- **Key Activities:**  
  - Use **CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployment (**Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI**).  
  - Containerization with **Docker** and orchestration with **Kubernetes**.  
  - Blue-Green, Canary, or Rolling deployment strategies.  

---

### **7. Operate** 🔧  
- **Objective:** Monitor and maintain the system.  
- **Key Activities:**  
  - Monitor application performance and availability.  
  - Use tools like **Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**.  
  - Manage infrastructure using **Ansible, Terraform, or Puppet**.  

---

### **8. Monitor & Feedback** 📊  
- **Objective:** Continuously improve performance and security.  
- **Key Activities:**  
  - Gather logs and metrics.  
  - Use APM tools like **Datadog, New Relic, Splunk**.  
  - Analyze feedback and integrate changes back into the planning stage.

### 🔹 **DevOps Workflow with GitHub, Maven, Tomcat, SonarQube & Jenkins**

1. **Developer writes code**

   * Developer writes application code (e.g., Java).
   * Pushes code to **GitHub repository**.

2. **Code versioning**

   * **GitHub** stores the source code.
   * Enables collaboration, branching, and version control.

3. **Build stage**

   * **Jenkins** detects code changes (via webhook or scheduled job).
   * Jenkins pulls latest code from **GitHub**.
   * Jenkins uses **Maven** to build the project → generates `.war` file.

4. **Code quality analysis**

   * During the build, Jenkins integrates with **SonarQube**.
   * SonarQube scans code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
   * Reports are sent back to Jenkins dashboard.

5. **Artifact storage (optional)**

   * The `.war` file can be uploaded to **Artifactory/Nexus** for versioned storage.

6. **Deployment stage**

   * Jenkins uses **Ansible** or built-in plugins.
   * Deploys `.war` file into **Tomcat (webapps/)** on testing/production servers.

7. **Application running**

   * Tomcat automatically deploys the `.war` file.
   * The application is now accessible to users/testers.

8. **Feedback & Monitoring**

   * Testers/QA verify the deployed application.
   * Developers get feedback for fixes → cycle repeats.

👉 **Workflow Summary (Tools at Each Stage):**

* **Developer** → Writes code
* **GitHub** → Stores code
* **Jenkins** → CI/CD automation
* **Maven** → Builds `.war` file
* **SonarQube** → Code quality check
* **Tomcat** → Deploys & runs application
