java set up:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y

Download the java :

1.copy the latest version or any version of java and use wget 'javalink', after downloading of java, set ENV variables before to that unzip or extract if the files are tar or zip files by using 'tar -xvzf' or 'unzip'.
2. you can download java file to local system and then you can copy to the instance or linux terminal by using the below command 'sudo cp -r /home/ec2-user/jdk-17.0.12/* /home/ec2-user/jdk-25/'.
3. Or you can directly install by using below one 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y

set environment variable:

to know the java path use this "readlink -f $(which java)" or go to java path where u download and do pwd, take that path and use it for env setup.

Verify installation:
java -version


set in /etc/.bashrc
export JAVA_HOME=java_path
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
echo $JAVA_HOME

After setting the Java environment variables, run "source ~/.bashrc" to apply the changes:
export JAVA_HOME=/home/ec2-user/jdk-25
export MAVEN_HOME=/home/ec2-user/apache-maven-3.9.11
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$MAVEN_HOME/bin

MAVEN:if you are using maven, follow same as java 

export MAVEN_HOME=/home/ec2-user/apache-maven-3.9.11
export 

after installation of tomcat, you need to change the portal in apache-tomcat/conf/server.xml, change port the '8080' to '8081'.
tomcat : to start the tomcat go to the path, where u installed and then go to bin, do 'ls' then u get the list in that choose to start tomcat.

eg; /opt/apache-tomcat/bin
select sh startup-sh   (here name of the tomcat is not needed while starting )

/home/ec2-user/apache-tomcat-11.0.11/webapps

you need to install the jenkins in this path , '/home/ec2-user/apache-tomcat-11.0.11/webapps' , y because to host the jenkins, we need web application, then only we can access. or we can copy the 'jenkins.war' and  place in that path if you installed in diffent place instead of tomcat.
 

When you install the jenkins , 
Here there are different ways to run the java. 
 
If you are using http as web server, then you can you 'java -jar jenkins.war' 
or using apache-tomcat , you can just start the tomcat, then the jenkins will work, if not check the 'systemctl status jenkins'.

1.after creating a job in the jenkins and click on build now, then the result is in the home/ec2-user/.jenkins/workspace/jobs.

Maven installation.
 Maven phases:
 
 maven compile: the code is in the human readeable languague, by doing compailing the code convert in to binary form, system readeable language.
  the code convert into class files or binary files.
  
  maven test: after compailing, there will be run the unit tests then test files 
  
  maven package: after testing, all files are combined and make into .war or .jar files.
  
  
  
  mvn clean package: src
                     pom.xml
					 target
  
  
  
 



Ansible setup:

create the instances in the aws  like ubuntu, redhat,aws,
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-44-9 ~]$ sudo su
[root@ip-172-31-44-9 ec2-user]# hostnamectl set-hostname host2-ansible =to change the hostname (optional)
[root@ip-172-31-44-9 ec2-user]#
exit
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-44-9 ~]$ sudo su
[root@host2-ansible ec2-user]#
[root@host2-ansible ec2-user]# cd /etc/ssh/       ===== to enable the sshd-config, cd to /etc/ssh/ and ls in ssh and vi sshd-config to enable the below 1 note
[root@host2-ansible ssh]# ls

In all servers:

1) Enable sshd_config - /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	PermitRootLogin yes
	PubkeyAuthentication yes
	PasswordAuthentication yes  

After change the configuration restart sshd
# systemctl restart sshd 


2) 
# ssh-keygen - in mgmt server and got # cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  copy the key into remote server "authorized_keys"
 
3) Install ansible:
 sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y    ===for update
sudo apt install ansible -y                    === for installation

4) We can add the ips in the hosts/(inventory)file. inventory file means where we can add the names or users or ips of the manage nodes.
cd /etc/ansible/    if ansible is not available u can create and add the inventory.
do ls and then 
add managenode ips in hosts file.
Ex:
[my_servers]       [my_servers]
13.61.176.142      16.171.194.244
16.171.170.186     13.60.36.72

5) write playbook 
---
- name: Create a file and install HTTPD on remote servers
  hosts: my_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create a file
      file:
        path: /opt/hello.txt
        state: touch
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0777'

6)after writing the playbook, we can paste it in the config.yaml. config.yaml file is located in the 
root@mgmt-ansible:/opt# vi config.yaml
root@mgmt-ansible:/opt# ansible-playbook config.yaml
