What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment,  and task automation. It simplifies IT automation by allowing users to define infrastructure as code (IaC).

ansible is used mainly for below 3 tasks,
installation  automate the installation of the software in variable servers.
configuration  update already existing confg, add new confg and delete confg
deployment   to deploy the web servers or other servers

Main Aim of Ansible
The primary goal of Ansible is to automate IT infrastructure by simplifying configuration management, application deployment, and system administration tasks.

Key Objectives of Ansible:

Automate Repetitive Tasks
Reduces manual effort in configuring and managing servers.
Examples: Installing software, updating configurations, managing users.
Ensure Consistency and Standardization
Avoids human errors by enforcing Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
Ensures all servers have the same configuration.

Key Features of Ansible

Agentless: No need to install any software on managed nodes; it uses SSH for communication.
Simple YAML Syntax: Uses YAML-based playbooks to define automation tasks.
Idempotent: Ensures tasks run only if required, preventing unnecessary canges.
Declarative & Procedural: Can define the desired state of a system or execute tasks step-by-step.
Scalable & Secure: Can manage thousands of servers securely using SSH.

How Ansible Works

Control Node: The machine where Ansible runs (no agent required on managed nodes).
Inventory: A list of servers (hosts) to be managed.
Playbooks: YAML files containing tasks and configurations.
Modules: Predefined functions (e.g., apt, yum, copy, file) to automate tasks.
Connection: Uses SSH (Linux) or WinRM (Windows) for communication.
Common Use Cases
Server Provisioning (installing software, configuring services).
Configuration Management (ensuring consistent system configurations).
Application Deployment (automating code deployment).
Orchestration (managing multiple systems, containers, and cloud environments).
Security & Compliance Automation (applying security policies across servers).

Ansible setup:

create the instances in the aws  like ubuntu, redhat,aws,
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-44-9 ~]$ sudo su
[root@ip-172-31-44-9 ec2-user]# hostnamectl set-hostname host2-ansible =to change the hostname (optional)
[root@ip-172-31-44-9 ec2-user]#
exit
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-44-9 ~]$ sudo su
[root@host2-ansible ec2-user]#
[root@host2-ansible ec2-user]# cd /etc/ssh/       ===== to enable the sshd-config, cd to /etc/ssh/ and ls in ssh and vi sshd-config to enable the below 1 note
[root@host2-ansible ssh]# ls

In all servers:

1) Enable sshd_config - /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	PermitRootLogin yes
	PubkeyAuthentication yes
	PasswordAuthentication yes  

After change the configuration restart sshd
# systemctl restart sshd 


2) 
# ssh-keygen - in mgmt server and got # cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  copy the key into remote server "authorized_keys"
 
3) Install ansible:
 sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y    ===for update
sudo apt install ansible -y                    === for installation

4) We can add the ips in the hosts/(inventory)file. inventory file means where we can add the names or users or ips of the manage nodes.
cd /etc/ansible/    if ansible is not available u can create and add the inventory.
do ls and then 
add managenode ips in hosts file.
Ex:
[my_servers]       [my_servers]
13.61.176.142      16.171.194.244
16.171.170.186     13.60.36.72

5) write playbook 
---
- name: Create a file and install HTTPD on remote servers
  hosts: my_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create a file
      file:
        path: /opt/hello.txt
        state: touch
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0777'

6)after writing the playbook, we can paste it in the config.yaml. config.yaml file is located in the 
root@mgmt-ansible:/opt# vi config.yaml
root@mgmt-ansible:/opt# ansible-playbook config.yaml

Tools to Help to validate the syntax

 *VSCode with Ansible plugins – for syntax highlighting
 *Online YAML to JSON converters – to understand the structure
 *YAML linters – to validate your syntax

the automatic logout timeout for your AWS Linux servers is set too low:
===========================================================================

Time extention for time out from aws instalce 
TMOUT=1000000
sudo vi /etc/profile

source ~/.bashrc

=====================
java set up:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y

Verify installation:

java -version


set environment variable:

set in /etc/.bashrc
export JAVA_HOME=java_path
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
echo $JAVA_HOME

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/bin/java

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

tomcat : to start the tomcat go to the tomcat where u installed and then change into bin do ls then u get the list . in that choose to start tomcat
eg; /opt/apache-tomcat/bin
select sh startup-sh   (here name of the tomcat is not needed while starting )


Jenkins installation:
If you install the jenkins in /opt , then the path of jenkins is below one
/opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.104/webapps/jenkins.war
