What is Maven? ðŸš€
Maven is a build automation and project management tool primarily used for Java projects. It helps developers manage dependencies, compile code, run tests, and package applications efficiently.


Maven Build Lifecycle: 
Maven has a well-defined build lifecycle that automates the process of compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying Java projects. The lifecycle consists of different phases, and each phase performs a specific task.

Maven has three main lifecycles:

Clean Lifecycle â€“         Cleans the project before a fresh build.

Default/(Build)Lifecycle â€“  Handles the complete build process.

Site Lifecycle â€“          Generates project documentation.


Phase	Description	Example Command
1. validate	Ensures the project structure and configuration are correct.	mvn validate
2. compile	Compiles the source code into .class files.	                    mvn compile
3. test	Runs unit tests using frameworks like JUnit or TestNG.	            mvn test
4. package	Creates a .jar (for Java apps) or .war (for web apps).       	mvn package
5. verify	Runs additional checks to ensure package quality.	            mvn verify
6. install	Installs the package into the local Maven repository.	        mvn install
7. deploy	Uploads the package to a remote repository for sharing.     	mvn deploy




































w Maven Works? ðŸ”„
Uses pom.xml â€“ A file that defines dependencies, plugins, and build configurations.

Fetches Dependencies â€“ Downloads required libraries from Maven repositories.

Compiles & Tests Code â€“ Automates the build and testing process.

Packages Application â€“ Creates .jar or .war files for deployment.

Basic Maven Commands:
mvn clean â†’ Removes old build files.

mvn compile â†’ Compiles the source code.

mvn test â†’ Runs tests.

mvn package â†’ Creates a .jar or .war file.

mvn install â†’ Installs the package locally.
